#1. Print "Hello World!"
print("Hello World!")
#2. Create 3 variables that each randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, named A, B, and C.
import random
A = random.randint(1,10)
B = random.randint(1,10)
C = random.randint(1,10)
#3. Print A, B, and C on the same line.
print(A,B,C)
#4. Make an if statement that prints if variable A is greater than, less than, or equal to 5.
if A > 5:
    print(f"{A} is greater than 5")
elif A < 5:
    print(f"{A} is less than 5")
else:
    print(f"{A} is equal to 5")
#5. Make an if statement that prints if variable B is between 3 and 7, or not.
if B > 3 and B < 7:
    print(f"{B} is greater than 3 and less than 7")
else :
    print(f"{B} is not important in this situation")
#6. Make an if statement that prints if variable C is even or odd.
if C % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{C} is even")
else:
    print(f"{C} is odd")
#7. Create a variable whose value is 3 + a randomly generated number between 1 and 20
d20 = random.randint(1,20)
D = 3 + d20
print(D)
#8. Make an if statement that prints if the variable from #7 is greater than, less than, or equal to A + B + C.
if D < A + B + C:
    print(f"{D} is less than {A} and {B} and {C}")
elif D > A + B + C:
    print(f"{D} is greater than {A} and {B} and {C}")
else:
    print(f"{D} is equal than {A} and {B} and {C}")
